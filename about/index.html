	<h1>About me</h1>
	 
	<p>I'm a Postdoctoral Researcher in Economic, Social, and Demographic History at Radboud University. 
		I'm also affiliated with the International Institute of Social History, where I previously worked as a Junior Data Engineer and Doctoral Researcher. 
		My research addresses the causes and consequences of social inequalities in the past using various data sources. Current research topics include social mobility and inequalities on the labour market, female empowerment and education, and socioeconomic differences in cause-specific mortality.
