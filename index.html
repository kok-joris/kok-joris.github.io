	<h1>Hi there, I'm Joris Kok!</h1>
	<p>I'm a PhD candidate at the International Institute of Social History and the Institute for History, Leiden University. My dissertation projects studies the social mobility of Jewish diamond workers, an important ethno-religious niche in pre-war Amsterdam. I am also involved in a project which constructs a Historical Gender Gap Index for each of Sweden's counties between 1870 and 1990.</p>
