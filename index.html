	<h1>About me</h1>
	    <p align="justify"> 
		    I am a PhD candidate at the International Institute of Social History in Amsterdam and the Institute for History, Leiden University. My research encompasses economic history and historical demography, focusing on social mobility and careers of groups at the fringe of the labour market. In my dissertation I study the social mobility and integration of Jewish diamond workers, an important ethno-religious niche in pre-war Amsterdam. Outside of my dissertation, I am combining new methods in order to examine Jewish life courses.

	<p>I am also involved in a project on gender equality in Sweden.</p>
	
	<p>Since 2022 I have been a board member for the <a href="http://www.younghistoricaldemographers.com/" target="_blank">Association for Young Historical Demographers</a>.</p>
