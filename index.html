	<h1>About me</h1>
	    <p align="justify"> 
		    I am a PhD candidate at the International Institute of Social History in Amsterdam and the Institute for History, Leiden University. 
		    My research encompasses economic history and historical demography, focusing on social mobility and the lives and careers of groups on the fringes of the labour market. 
		    In my dissertation I study the social mobility and integration of Jewish diamond workers, an important ethno-religious niche in pre-war Amsterdam.
		    Outside of my dissertation, I am combining new methods to create datasets which will allow researchers to examine the life courses of different Dutch Jewish populations.

		Since my studies in Lund, Sweden, I have also been involved in a project on gender equality in Sweden. 
		Recently, our paper on the <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/D50225E04E4573AA7D3B175032291B2C/S0022050723000359a.pdf/the-historical-gender-gap-index-a-longitudinal-and-spatial-assessment-of-sweden-1870-1990.pdf" target="_blank">Historical Gender Gap Index in Sweden</a> was published. 
		Future works will assess spatial differences in gender equality and the consequences of human capital attainment for Swedish women.

		Starting in 2022, I have been a board member for the <a href="http://www.younghistoricaldemographers.com/" target="_blank">Association for Young Historical Demographers</a>.
		Our organisation tries to bring young scholars in historical demography together and to exchange questions, ideas and experiences.
